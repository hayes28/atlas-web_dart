# Root README for Dart Projects

## 0x00-hello-dart
**Description**

This introductory project serves as a foundation for exploring the Dart programming language. It focuses on essential concepts and techniques that form the building blocks for more complex Dart applications.

**Objectives**

This project aims to solidify your understanding of core Dart programming concepts, including:

- Output using the print() function
- Variables and their usage
- Basic data types (strings, integers, doubles)
- Assertions for code validation
- Simple conditional logic for decision-making

## 0x01-dart-function
**Description**

This Dart project showcases a collection of functions to demonstrate practical applications of core Dart concepts, including variables, conditional statements, loops, and recursion. The code explores essential programming techniques while adhering to Dart best practices.

**Objectives**

- Function Fundamentals: Grasp the concept of functions as reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. Understand how to define functions, pass arguments, and return values.
- Problem Decomposition: Develop the ability to break a problem down into smaller, manageable functions, improving code readability and organization.
- Control Flow: Practice using conditional statements (if, else if, else) and loops (for, while) to control the execution of code within functions.
- Scope and Abstraction: Understand the concept of variable scope within functions and how functions help promote code abstraction.
- Recursion: Introduce the concept of recursion (functions calling themselves) to solve problems elegantly.
- Practical Applications: Explore how functions are used in practical scenarios such as calculations, string manipulation, data processing, and decision-making.

## 0x02-dart-classes
**Description**

This project explores the fundamentals of object-oriented programming in Dart. You'll create classes, manipulate properties, implement methods, work with JSON, and apply concepts of inheritance.

**Objectives**

- Object-Oriented Programming Foundations: Gain a solid understanding of the core principles of OOP, including classes, objects, properties, and methods.
- Encapsulation: Learn how to create classes that bundle data (properties) and related behaviors (methods) together, promoting code organization and maintainability.
- Abstraction: Practice reducing complexity by modeling real-world concepts as classes in your code.
- Inheritance: Explore how to create class hierarchies, enabling code reuse and the modeling of "is-a" relationships.
- Data Serialization/Deserialization: Master the process of converting objects into a format suitable for storage or transmission (JSON) and vice versa.
- Null Safety: Understand Dart's null-aware operators and how to effectively handle potential null values.

### Task-Specific Objectives

- Welcome:

    - Define a custom class (User).
    - Implement methods within a class.

- User to JSON:

    - Work with different data types within a class.
    - Serialize class data into a structured format (JSON).
- Password:

    - Create a class to represent a password.
    - Enforce specific validation rules for data integrity.
    - Control how a class is represented as a string (toString()).
- Private Password

    - Grasp the concept of private members within a class.
- Mutables

    - Use getters and setters to provide controlled access to private members.
- JSON to User

    - Deserialize data (JSON) to create class instances.
    - Provide a meaningful string representation of objects.
- Inheritance

    - Establish relationships between classes to promote code reuse.
    - Combine object properties and behaviors from multiple classes.
    - Handle potential null values and type safety in an inheritance context.
